# ðŸš€ Quick Start - NEPSE Live Scraper

## Run Everything in One Command

```bash
./start_live_scraper.sh
```

That's it! This script will:
1. âœ… Start all Docker containers (Kafka, Airflow, etc.)
2. âœ… Copy streaming files to container
3. âœ… Install dependencies
4. âœ… Start NEPSE producer (scraping every 100ms)
5. âœ… Show live dashboard with real-time stock prices

## What You'll See

The dashboard will show:
- ðŸ“Š Market summary (total stocks, gainers, losers)
- ðŸ“ˆ Top gainers (stocks going up)
- ðŸ“‰ Top losers (stocks going down)
- ðŸ”„ Updates every 5 seconds

Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the dashboard.

## If Containers Are Already Running

If your Docker containers are already up, you can skip the startup and just run the scraper:

```bash
# Quick run (containers already running)
cd streaming/scripts
./producer.sh 100    # In terminal 1
./dashboard.sh       # In terminal 2
```
