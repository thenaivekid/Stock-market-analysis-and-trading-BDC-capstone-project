# BigDataCluster Integration - Migration Notes

## Changes Made

### 1. Repository Integration
- ✅ Removed `.git` directory from `BigDataCluster/` subdirectory
- ✅ Integrated BigDataCluster as part of the main repository
- ✅ Created comprehensive root `.gitignore` file

### 2. Fixed Docker Configuration Issues
- **Network Issue**: Removed manual network creation from Makefile (let Docker Compose manage it)
- **Spark Image**: Changed from `bitnami/spark:3.5` to `apache/spark:3.5.0` with proper configuration
- **Kafka Image**: Downgraded to `confluentinc/cp-kafka:7.4.0` for Zookeeper compatibility

### 3. Services Running
All Big Data services are now running successfully:
- ✅ Airflow (port 8090)
- ✅ HDFS Namenode (port 9870)
- ✅ HDFS Datanode
- ✅ Spark Master (port 8080, 7077)
- ✅ Spark Worker
- ✅ Kafka (port 9092)
- ✅ Zookeeper (port 2181)

### 4. Testing Setup
- ✅ Created `BigDataCluster/requirements-dev.txt` for development dependencies
- ✅ Installed PySpark 3.5.0 for running tests
- ✅ All unit tests passing (2 tests in test_etl.py)

## .gitignore Coverage

The root `.gitignore` now includes:
- Python bytecode files (`*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.pyd`)
- `__pycache__/` directories
- Virtual environments
- IDE configurations (.idea/, .vscode/)
- Docker volumes and logs
- Hadoop/Spark temporary files
- Airflow logs and databases
- Kafka logs
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- Credentials and secrets

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install development dependencies
cd BigDataCluster
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
make test
```

## Starting Services

```bash
cd BigDataCluster

# Start all services
make start-all

# Stop all services
make stop-all

# Individual services
make start-airflow
make start-hdfs
make start-spark
make start-kafka
```

## Access Points

- **Airflow UI**: http://localhost:8090 (username: admin, password: admin)
- **Spark UI**: http://localhost:8080
- **HDFS UI**: http://localhost:9870
- **Kafka**: localhost:9092

## Files Modified

- Modified: `BigDataCluster/Makefile` - Removed manual network management
- Modified: `BigDataCluster/infra/spark/spark-compose.yml` - Updated Spark image and config
- Modified: `BigDataCluster/infra/kafka/kafka-compose.yml` - Updated Kafka version and config
- Added: `BigDataCluster/requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
- Added: `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore patterns
- Removed: `BigDataCluster/.git/` - Nested git repository
- Removed: `BigDataCluster/.gitignore` - Consolidated to root

## Next Steps

1. Commit the changes to git
2. Consider adding CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
3. Document the ETL pipeline architecture
4. Add integration tests for the full data pipeline
